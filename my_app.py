    **Climate Zone Risk Level**: This shows how different climate zones affect the potential yield of crops. It helps farmers see which zones are riskier or more stable for crop production.

    **Recommendations**: Based on temperature changes, this section gives farmers recommendations for their crops, such as switching to heat-tolerant crops or improving irrigation.

    **Correlation Analysis**: This section shows how different factors (like water productivity, temperature, and climate zones) are related to crop yield.

    **Water Productivity Analysis**: This shows how efficiently water is being used to produce crops. It can help farmers understand how to optimize water usage.

    **Crop vs Climate Zone**: This cross-tab analysis shows which crops perform best in different climate zones.
